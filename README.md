# Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m [Giulio](https://www.giuliostarace.com), welcome to my GitHub profile. I
use GitHub for a variety of things, and I tend to keep my old work around as a
way to look back and reminisce. Hopefully this little blurb helps you find what
you're after. If you're just browsing, I've marked my favorite stuff with a ★.
